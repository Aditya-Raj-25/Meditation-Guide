    What is Drishya Dhyan?
Drishya Dhyan involves focusing the mind on a specific visual object or mental image. This could include:

Physical Objects:
A candle flame (Tratak meditation).
A natural element like a flower, tree, or the sky.
A sacred symbol, like an Om symbol or a deity's image.
Mental Imagery:
Visualizing peaceful landscapes like mountains or rivers.
Imagining a light spreading warmth and positivity within you.
Guided Visualizations:
Listening to a teacher or audio guide that directs you to visualize certain images or scenarios.
How to Practice Drishya Dhyan
Preparation:

Choose a quiet and comfortable place with minimal distractions.
Sit in a relaxed posture with your back straight.
Keep the lighting soft and calming.
Choose a Focal Point:

If using a physical object, place it at eye level to avoid strain.
For mental imagery, close your eyes and imagine the chosen scene or object.
Focus Your Attention:

Direct your gaze or inner vision to the focal point.
Observe its details—shape, color, texture, or movement.
If thoughts arise, gently bring your focus back to the visual object or image.
Breathe Mindfully:

Combine the practice with slow, deep breathing to enhance relaxation.
Synchronize your breath with the image (e.g., visualize inhaling light and exhaling stress).
End with Gratitude:

Gently bring your awareness back to your surroundings.
Spend a moment appreciating the calm and clarity achieved.
