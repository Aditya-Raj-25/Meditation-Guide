    </div>
    <div class="xyz">
      Tratak Dhyan is a meditative technique where you fix your gaze on an external object (like a candle flame) or an
      internal image (visualized in the mind). This practice helps clear mental distractions and allows the practitioner
      to attain a heightened state of awareness.

      <h2 id="l">Preparation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Practice in a distraction-free, dimly lit room</li>
        <li>If using a candle, place it at eye level about 2-3 feet away from you.
        </li>
        <li>Ensure the flame is steady and not flickering due to air movement</li>
        <li>Sit in a cross-legged position (e.g., Sukhasana) or on a chair with a straight back.</li>
        <li>Keep your head, neck, and spine aligned.</li>
        <li>Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths to relax your body and mind.</li>
        <li>Fix your gaze on the chosen object without blinking.</li>
        <li>
          Fix your gaze on the chosen object without blinking.
        </li>
        <li>Maintain an unwavering focus for as long as you can without blinking</li>
        <li>If tears form in your eyes, allow them to flow naturally.</li>
        <li>After gazing for a few minutes (or until your eyes feel strained), gently close your eyes.</li>
        <li>Visualize the image of the object in your mindâ€™s eye. Focus on this mental image as long as possible.</li>
        <li>Open your eyes slowly and return to normal awareness.</li>
        <li> End the session with gratitude and reflection.</li>
