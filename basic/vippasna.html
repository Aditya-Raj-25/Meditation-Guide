    <div>What is Vipassana Dhyan?</div>
    <div>Vipassana is a practice of self-observation and inner purification. Unlike concentration meditation, which involves focusing on a single object (like a mantra or flame), Vipassana encourages the practitioner to observe sensations, thoughts, and feelings as they arise and pass, cultivating a deep understanding of impermanence, suffering, and non-self.

    <div>How to Practice Vipassana Dhyan</div>
    <div>Preparation
      <ul>
        <li>Environment: Choose a quiet, comfortable place free from distractions.</li>
        <li>Posture: Sit in a relaxed yet upright position, such as cross-legged (Sukhasana), or on a chair with your feet flat.</li>
        <li>Attitude: Approach the practice with patience, curiosity, and non-judgment.</li>
        <li>
          Close your eyes and focus on the natural flow of your breath.

        <li>Close your eyes and focus on the natural flow of your breath.</li>
        <li>Let your breath flow naturally; do not attempt to control it.</li>
        <li>Gradually shift your attention to the sensations in your body.</li>
        <li>Start from the top of your head and slowly scan down to your toes, observing:
          Tingling, warmth, coolness, or other sensations.
          Areas of tension or relaxation.
          Avoid reacting to sensations. Simply observe them without craving or aversion.</li>
          <li>Allow thoughts and emotions to arise naturally.
          </li>
          <li>Instead of suppressing or indulging them, observe their impermanence and let them fade away</li>
          <li>As you progress, expand your awareness to subtle sensations or deeper layers of mental patterns.</li>
          <li>Continue observing with a balanced and detached attitude.</li>
      </ul>
