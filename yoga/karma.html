    <h2>Steps to Practice Karma Yoga Meditation</h2>
    <h3 id="vel">Karma Yoga meditation involves incorporating mindfulness and intentionality into both stillness and action.
        Be fully present in every action, no matter how small.
Pay attention to the quality of your work and its impact on others.
Act without selfish desires or attachment to the outcomes.
Shift the focus from "What will I gain?" to "How can I contribute?"
Develop a sense of offering all your work to a higher purpose, whether to God, the universe, or humanity.
