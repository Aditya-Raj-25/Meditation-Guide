    Gyan Yoga (Jnana Yoga) in Meditation</div>
    <div>Gyan Yoga (also spelled as Jnana Yoga) is the path of wisdom and knowledge, focusing on self-inquiry and understanding the true nature of the self. This form of yoga is deeply philosophical and involves contemplation, study, and meditation to achieve enlightenment. Below is a detailed guide to practicing Gyan Yoga as a meditative process:</div>
    <div>Core Principles of Gyan Yoga
      <ul>
        <li>Viveka (Discernment): The ability to distinguish between what is eternal (unchanging) and what is temporal (changing).</li>
        <li>Vairagya (Detachment): Letting go of material desires and attachments to focus on higher truths.</li>
        <li>Shatsampat (Six Virtues): Mental discipline that includes calmness, control of the senses, and focus.</li>
        <li>Mumukshutva (Intense Desire for Liberation): A burning desire to achieve spiritual freedom and self-realization.</li>
        
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>Preparation for Gyan Yoga Meditation
      <ul>
        <li>Quiet Space: Choose a peaceful environment where you can meditate without distractions.</li>
        <li>Comfortable Sitting Position: Sit in a posture like Sukhasana (Easy Pose) or Padmasana (Lotus Pose). Ensure your spine is straight.
        </li>
        <li>Focus of Study: Have a central text or thought for contemplation, such as passages from the Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, or Vedantic philosophy.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>Steps for Gyan Yoga Meditation
      <ul>
        <li>Calm the Mind:
          <ul>
            <li>Begin with Pranayama to stabilize your breath and mind.
            </li>
            <li>
              Practice 5 minutes of Nadi Shodhana (Alternate Nostril Breathing) for clarity.

            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Invocation:
          <ul>
            <li>Chant a mantra like Om or a shloka (verse) to invoke a higher consciousness.</li>
            <li>Example: "Om Tat Sat" (a mantra signifying the ultimate truth).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Self-Inquiry (Atma Vichara):
          <ul>
            <li>Close your eyes and ask the question, "Who am I?"</li>
            <li>Reflect on the nature of your existence. Are you the body? The mind? Or something eternal beyond them?</li>
            <li>Avoid rushing for answers; let the inquiry unfold naturally.</li>
          </ul>

        </li>
        <li>Scriptural Reflection (Shravana):
          <ul>
            <li>Select a line or concept from a spiritual text (e.g., "Tat Tvam Asi" â€“ "You are That").</li>
            <li>Contemplate its meaning and relate it to your own experience.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Deep Contemplation (Manana):
          <ul>
            <li>Meditate on the insights gained from your self-inquiry and reflection.
            </li>
            <li>Example: If focusing on "I am not the body, I am pure consciousness," repeat this thought and visualize yourself as boundless awareness.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Absorption (Nididhyasana):
          <ul>
            <li>Let go of all thoughts and dwell in the experience of your true nature.</li>
            <li>Maintain awareness of your infinite, changeless self.</li>
            <li>If the mind wanders, gently bring it back to the central thought or question.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Techniques in Gyan Yoga Meditation
          <ul>
            <li>Identify anything you associate with yourself (e.g., body, emotions, roles).</li>
            <li>Mentally negate each one, saying "I am not this" to arrive at the essence of your being.
              </li>
              <li>Sit quietly and observe your thoughts without judgment.</li>
              <li>Understand that you are the witness, not the thinker.</li>
              <li>Focus on the unity of all existence.</li>
              <li>Reflect on the idea that the same consciousness exists in you, others, and the universe.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
